# The orchestrator runbook

One session. Registered with `board orchestrator --name <its title> --session
<its id> --app-id <its local_... id from get_session self>`; from then on it is the only session the hooks allow workers to
message, the only one allowed to ask Mario, and the only one whose turns may
end on a question. Its state is the board and git, never its own context: after
a compaction or a restart it reads both and continues.

Every tick (a `/loop`, twenty to thirty minutes), in this order:

1. **Read.** `board list --open`, then `board issues` (or `board tick`, which
   is both). Nothing else fetches a GitHub issue: it is pulled by that
   command or it never arrives. For each card with a bound branch, `board
show <id>` derives what git and GitHub say (commits ahead, dirty files, PR
   state). Move states from facts: a PR open is `review`, merged is `merged`,
   a tag containing the merge is `released`.
2. **Blockers.** For each open blocker:
   - `desk`, `device`: if a desk unit is free, drive the worker's repro script
     on it and unblock with what was seen; if not, leave it and note the queue.
   - `design`, `info`: answer it yourself if the memories, docs or code
     settle it; unblock with the answer on the card. Only if it is genuinely
     Mario's (product, taste, money, his hands, his credentials) convert it:
     `board ask <id> --ask '<one line>' --default '<what happens if nobody
answers>'`. Never forward a worker's wording; write the three lines
     yourself. **If the ask is a thing to do (flash, open, play, download, sign in), it
     carries `--steps`: numbered lines, one per line, that he can follow on
     the couch.** An ask without them for a thing to do is a defect: he went
     back to old conversations to find out how, once, and that is the failure
     the inbox exists to remove. A "needs-steps" answer from him reopens the
     card to its owner as an `info` blocker; the owner writes the steps and
     asks again.
   - `mario`: it is already in his inbox. Do nothing until `board answer`
     lands, then unblock the worker with the answer.
   - A whole card that is his decision goes on app `mario`, and lands in his
     inbox by itself: `board new "<the decision>" --from mario --default
'<what happens if he never answers>'`, or `board app <id> mario` for one
     already filed. It opens the blocker for you, asking the card's title, so
     write the title as the question. Give it a `--default`; the fallback is
     honest but generic, and an inbox of questions with no stated cost of
     silence is one he stops reading.
3. **Infrastructure.** A red gate, a full disk, a lock, a merge conflict:
   yours. Fix it or diagnose it and hand the diagnosis to the worker. Never
   edit app code yourself; whose file is that.
4. **Dispatch.** For each `triaged` card with no session, while fewer than the
   cap are `working`: start a worker with the card, the contract, and the
   app's doc. One worker per app at a time.
5. **Land.** Merges are pull requests; you hold the integration claim (`board
   You are not exempt from a worker's tree: the guard refuses your writes
   into `wt/<name>` like anyone else's, since a sweep from this seat once
   committed another worker's diff. Take a tree with `board bind ... --take`
   (it must be quiescent, or its session ended) or leave it. `board tree
   <name>` before any prune. `wt.sh drop` and `prune` clear the record of
   a tree they remove; `board trees` names any record whose tree is already
   gone, and `board tree <name> --release` clears one whoever held it, since
   a directory that no longer exists is nobody's. The day this lands: `board trees --seed` once,
   so every open card's tree gets a record and live workers are not refused
   from their own trees; a subagent then rebinds itself on its first refusal.
   Before a batch, `python3 tools_local/board/overlap.py`: two open pull
   requests that touch one file are each green alone and can be wrong
   together, and the bug would bisect to whichever landed second. Merge one,
   re-verify the other on the result, then merge it.
integrator --session <your id>`) only while you resolve a conflict or
   rebuild the emulator, and release it after. **After every merge, pull:**
   `git -C firmware-next pull --ff-only origin xteink` under the claim. The
   hooks, the `board` command and every runbook a session reads are the
   ones in firmware-next, so a merge nobody pulls changes nothing on this
   Mac; the guard once stayed a version behind for a whole evening that way.
6. **Close.** The board closes cards by itself since 2026-09-20, because
   closing by memory left 203 open: a merged pull request closes the card
   bound to its branch (`crossplay-board.yml` posts `workflow`/`merged`), and
   `board_expire()` runs daily: an alarm quiet for 7 days is done, a `merged`
   card is done after 2, a card a session filed that nobody claimed in 14
   days is parked as expired, and so is a session's own work untouched for
   14. Cards a person filed are never touched by the clock. What is left to
   you: worktree dropped, session archived. Leftovers are NOTICES (`board
   noticed`), never new cards. A session never outlives its card. Once a tick, `./scripts/wt.sh prune`: it drops every
   tree that is merged, clean and idle, and nothing else; a tree it keeps
   has work in it, and that work has a card or needs one.
7. **Cards nobody dispatched.** Two arrive by themselves; GitHub is a command
   you run. Pushed: `source: error` (an error event opened it; the count on
   the card's fingerprint says how often; treat it as a bug owned by the
   service it names) and `source: site` (a stranger's report; triage it like
   an internal one, and if it needs a reply the reporter's email is on the
   card for Mario, never for you). Since 2026-09-07 a `reporter: user` card
   is also in Mario's inbox, in its own section above the asks, until he
   marks it read: triage it normally, and never settle it just to clear his
   screen. Being seen is the point of it being there. `board seen` is refused
   for every session, yours included -- it is the only thing that takes a
   report out of the one place he looks, so running it is not triage, it is
   deleting the message. When he answers one, his sentence is on the card body
   under `Mario, on reading this:` and the card is already `triaged` -- that is
   a card to dispatch, not one to triage again. Pulled: `source: github` exists only
   because you typed `board issues` in step 1, and closing is manual too,
   `board issues --close-released` once a card is released.
8. **Upstream.** The daily sync routine opens `sync/upstream-<date>` pull
   requests; they land like any other on green. A sync that stopped on a
   conflict of intent leaves a pushed branch and a card: yours to resolve
   by the rules in docs/workflow/upstream-sync.md, never Mario's.
9. **Numbers.** You do not read them; the inbox page does. Your part is
   that every service's owner has wired the events its card names
   (docs/workflow/events.md), and that an error card that repeats after a
   fix is treated as a regression, not a duplicate.
10. **Mario.** He reads `board inbox` and nothing else. If nothing is there,
    he hears nothing from you.
