#
# The shot this replaced was made by hand and was wrong in a way nobody could
# have fixed without remaking it: a 2x render cropped to its top-left quadrant,
# so TRIVIA, the clue and the NEXT button were all cut off mid-word, and the
# picture disagreed with its own alt text. sim-shot.sh produces the frame the
# panel actually paints, at panel size, which is the whole reason to use it.
#
# THE STARTING STATE IS THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY, and here it is the pack:
#
#   trivia/pack.dat   ONE clue, written by seed_shot_pack.py -- the clue the
#                     alt text describes. The shipped pack is fifty thousand
#                     built from a dataset this repo does not carry, and which
#                     clue it deals depends on a scheduler; a one-clue pack
#                     makes the picture reproducible, which is the property
#                     that lets the alt text be checked against it.
#   shelf.cfg         "0 17 0" selects the Games folder and TRIVIA within it.
#                     Unused while AUTOSTART is set, written so the card is in
#                     a sane state if the shot is ever taken by hand.
#   CROSSPLAY_AUTOSTART=TRIVIA  opens the app rather than the shelf.
#
# Then two taps: QUIZMASTER on the front door, and REVEAL at the foot of the
# question. The shot is taken with the answer showing, because that is the
# state worth a picture -- an unrevealed clue is a wall of text with a button
# under it, and it is also the state the alt text describes.
