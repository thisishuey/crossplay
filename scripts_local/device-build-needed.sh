# One classification table, two questions asked of it.
#
# TWO QUESTIONS, and for a day they shared one predicate:
#
#   builds  Can this path change what a device build produces, or whether that
#           build can run? check.sh asks it before spending many minutes on the
#           cross-compiled envs behind a workspace-wide lock.
#   ships   Can this path change what a RELEASE delivers -- the firmware a
#           device runs, or the files the release publishes? release-needed.sh
#           asks it before bumping the version, tagging, and putting an update
#           prompt on every device in the field; release_notes.py asks it of
#           each landing before writing that landing into the notes.
#
# WHY THEY CANNOT SHARE ONE ANSWER. The old rule was a single allowlist of
# inert paths with `*) live` underneath it -- live by default, which is the
# right direction for one question and the wrong direction for the other:
#
#   question | an unknown path defaults to | cost of being wrong
#   ---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------
#   builds   | build it                    | wasted minutes on a runner
#   ships    | release it                  | every device offered an update for
#            |                             | nothing
#
# v1.12.21 is what that cost looks like. The only path in v1.12.20..v1.12.21
# that was not inert was `.gitignore`, which is genuinely live for a build --
# a `--committed` gate materialises a trial worktree FROM GIT, so what is
# ignored decides what exists there to compile -- and cannot alter one byte of
# a published image, because a clean clone checks out every tracked file
# whatever the ignore rules say. One answer, read for both questions, cut a
# release whose only device-reaching change was the version number the release
# itself wrote.
#
# It fails in the other direction too, and that half is board card #190:
# `.github/**` is inert for a build, so PR #42 -- the fix for the packaging
# defect that shipped v1.12.14 and v1.12.15 with bootloader.bin, firmware.bin
# and partitions.bin MISSING from the published image -- was classified "no
# device can see it". A repair to what gets published was invisible to the
# thing deciding whether to publish, and to the notes describing what was
# published.
#
# So: one table, two columns, and both questions read the table rather than
# each other. There is still exactly one definition of each, which is the
# property the old single predicate was protecting and this keeps.
#
# AN UNCLASSIFIED PATH IS NOT A DEFAULT. `*) return 1` answered confidently
# about a file nobody had ever classified, and that confidence is why this went
# a day unnoticed. A path in no row now:
#
#   builds  runs the builds AND names itself. Never skip verification, and
#           never do it silently -- the loud line is what gets the row added.
#   ships   REFUSES. Exit 2, naming the path. Releasing and withholding are
#           both bad answers to a question nobody has answered, so it declines
#           to pick one and says which path it could not classify.

# Exit 3: --ships only -- QUIET. A person receives something different, but
#         only in how it was packaged. It cuts a release; it does not
#         automatically earn a line on the page. See the `quiet` value below.

# ("some run is building release images, so answer conservatively"); for the
# build loop it is that run's OWN intent, and a question whose answer is
# derived from the asker's intent is circular. So this mode alone does not
# consult it. Everything else about the answer -- the table, the fail-safe
# exits, the untracked-file handling -- is identical, because a second spelling

#
# The `builds` column is a refactor and not a change: it reproduces, path for
# path, the answer the previous single predicate gave, including its three
# conservative entries (nix/, requirements.txt, .gitignore) and its treatment
# of scripts_local/ as live. host-tests/gatepath asserts every one of them and
# went green unchanged. Loosening that column is a separate change needing its
# own evidence; this one only stops the release questions reading it.
#
# The `ships` column is new, and it has THREE values, because "should this cut
# a release" and "should this be a line on the page a player reads" are also
# two questions, and collapsing them was the same fault one level down.
#
#   no     nobody receives anything different.
#   yes    a person receives something different IN THE THING THEY USE -- the
#          firmware their device runs. Whatever describes the change describes
#          it in their terms, so it cuts a release and earns a line.
#   quiet  a person receives something different only in HOW IT WAS PACKAGED.
#          It cuts a release, because the release really does deliver something
#          else. It does NOT automatically earn a line, because nothing about a
#          build workflow describes itself in a player's words: the notes would
#          print the pull request's title, and "build both devices in one pio
#          run, and stop misdescribing why" is the developer prose this whole
#          change exists to keep off that page. release_notes.py gives such a
#          landing a bullet only when its pull request WROTE one ("What is new:
#          ..."), and crossplay-ci.yml asks for that line at pull-request time
#          so the page never silently loses a packaging fix.
#
# NOT the website in any of the three -- crossplay.ma-r-s.com deploys
# continuously from site/ and is not part of a release, so a site change must
# never cut one.

# --no-renames on the diff, and it is the difference between a rule and a
# hazard. `git diff --name-only` runs rename DETECTION by default and collapses
# a detected rename to the NEW path only -- the old one never appears, with no
# arrow to split on. So `git mv src/main.cpp docs/main.cpp` presented as one
# inert path, and the rule cheerfully skipped every device build for a commit
# that removed a compiled translation unit. `git mv
# scripts_local/require_build_lock.py docs/x.py` did the same for a file that
# runs INSIDE every device build; that commit breaks the build for the whole
# workspace and this said it needed no verification.
#
# --no-renames reports the pair as a delete plus an add, so BOTH endpoints are
# classified and the old path forces the build. The `sed 's/ -> /\n/'` below
# was already there for the same hazard in `git status --porcelain`, whose
# rename format DOES carry an arrow -- and that naive first-occurrence split is
# safe for a structural reason worth writing down, because it looks unsafe: a
# path containing the literal " -> " makes git quote the endpoint
# UNCONDITIONALLY, regardless of core.quotePath, and a quoted fragment begins
# with a `"` that no row of the table can match. So a mangled split always
# leaves at least one fragment that falls through to unclassified -- which
# builds, and refuses to say whether it ships. A review tried core.quotePath,
# spaces, quotes, embedded newlines and non-ASCII against it and could not hide
# a firmware path -- so the author had seen this coming and the fix simply never
# reached the committed half, which is the half --committed uses exclusively
# (its trial worktree is a clean checkout, so `git status` there is empty by

  # The MIRROR question: not "can this change a device image" but "can the host
  # gate see it at all". The simulator target does not compile what sits behind
  # FREEINK_DEVICE_* guards, what calls ESP-IDF directly, or the SDK driver
  # layer, so for such a branch a green host gate is not weak evidence, it is
  # NO evidence.
  #
  # THIS WAS A DENYLIST UNTIL 2026-09-01, while its comment claimed it was
  # "conservative by construction... anything it cannot rule out keeps its
  # device build". That sentence described the behaviour below; the code did
  # the opposite. It demanded a device gate ONLY for freeink-sdk,
  # platformio*.ini, partitions.csv, and src|lib files carrying an ESP-IDF
  # marker -- and answered "host-green is sufficient" for EVERYTHING else, with
  # no crafted input required:
  #
  #   scripts_local/require_build_lock.py  runs INSIDE every device build
  #   scripts_local/check.sh               the gate's own machinery
  #   scripts/build_html.py                a pre: generator, runs in the build
  #   nix/flake.nix                        pins which pio and which toolchain
  #   brandnew/x.c                         a new top-level directory
  #   deleting src/main.cpp                `[ -f ]` failed, so it was skipped
  #
  # That is not plumbing: docs/contributing/landing-and-integration.md points
  # humans at this exact command as the bar for landing on host-green. Someone
  # editing build infrastructure was told it was safe to land, and no device
  # build ever confirmed the edit. The comment being right is precisely why
  # nobody read the code.
  #
  # It is an ALLOWLIST now, and it delegates the first question to the table's
  # builds column rather than restating it -- one spelling of the rule, for the
  # reason this file keeps repeating. Three ways to be sufficient, and unknown
  # is not one:
  #
  #   1. builds() says no  cannot reach a device image, so no device build
  #                        could report anything about it either way.
  #   2. src/ or lib/ WITH the file present and free of device-only markers:
  #                        the host target really does compile it.
  #   3. nothing else.
