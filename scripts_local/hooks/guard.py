"""Claude Code hooks that make the workspace rules physical.

Three rules kept getting forgotten because they lived in prose: work never
happens in the integration tree, workers talk only to the orchestrator, and
a turn does not end by handing the decision back to Mario. This script is
wired from the workspace root's .claude/settings.json and runs as:

    guard.py pretool        PreToolUse: refuse the edit, command or message
    guard.py stop           Stop: refuse to end a turn on a hand-back
    guard.py session-start  SessionStart: print the contract and the session id

It reads the board (<workspace>/.board, written only by tools_local/board/
board.py) to know who the orchestrator is, who holds the integration tree,
and which card this session is bound to. It is INERT until
<workspace>/.board/enabled exists, so installing it changes nothing; arming it
is one `touch`, disarming is one `rm`.

Exit 2 with a reason on stderr is the only way a hook blocks; anything else
is a no-op. host-tests/bugflow/run.sh drives every branch below with fixture
input, including the ones that must NOT block.
