# thrown away, and not one of them can be reproduced today.
#
# THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY IS THE STARTING STATE. The DIAL is the screen worth
# showing: it is the one the table stares at, and it is the only one carrying
# the strip, the marker, the number and both end words at once. Reaching it
# takes five taps, and each has to land after the previous screen has painted.
#
#   CROSSPLAY_AUTOSTART   skips the shelf and opens the app.
#   fs_agent              the agent's own card, never Mario's fs_mario.
#
# WHAT IS NOT DETERMINISTIC: which spectrum is dealt. The RNG is seeded from
# millis(), so the pair in the shot changes every run, and so does the guess the
# taps land on. The alt text in site/index.html names the pair, so if you
# regenerate this, either update the alt text or re-run until it matches. Do not
# describe a picture you have not looked at.
