"""Write the next release: its version, the page it publishes, and the history.

Run by .github/workflows/crossplay-autorelease.yml after every green CI run on
xteink, and by hand for a look:

    scripts_local/release_notes.py --dry-run           # print what it would do
    scripts_local/release_notes.py --write             # bump and write both files

It reads the merges on the first-parent line since the newest v* tag, asks
GitHub for each merge's pull request, takes the pull request's "What is new"
line(s), and falls back to the merge's own subject. `[crossplay] version` in
platformio.ini goes up one patch (one minor if any merged pull request carries
the `release:minor` label), and TWO files are written:

    docs/release-body.md    the page this release publishes. Its
                            `### What is new in <version>` block is replaced;
                            the one line of links above it is left exactly as
                            written. That line is the whole of the page's
                            standing text -- the install steps, the asset
                            explanations and the project description that used
                            to sit here are in README.md and docs/install.md,
                            which is where they were the entire time.
    docs/release-notes.md   the history. The same block is PREPENDED, so every
                            release is kept and no release page carries anybody
                            else's.

That split is the fix for a body of 20,402 characters. docs/release-notes.md
was both the page and the archive, so v1.12.21's release page opened with a
standing catalogue of nineteen games, said what was new in 1.12.21, and then
said what WAS new in 1.12.12, 1.12.11, 1.12.10, 1.12.9, 1.12.8 and 1.12.7.
Every release page carried the entire history. A release page says what changed
in THAT release and links to the rest.

Only landings a person could receive anything different from become notes.
v1.12.17 listed all seven merges since the previous tag, and four of them -- a
board watcher, a server-side bridge and two release-pipeline fixes -- change
nothing anybody receives. Mario got the update prompt on his device, read this
file's output for that version, and asked why a release had happened at all.
The one line that did reach the firmware, an upstream sync, named the operation
and not one thing it changed. Both halves are fixed here: reaches_a_user() asks
the one table that already classifies paths
(scripts_local/device-build-needed.sh --ships), and a sync's body is read for
the upstream subjects its title hides.

The excluded landings are named on stdout, where the autorelease log keeps
them, and NOT in the published body. They used to be a bullet -- "Plus 4
changes nothing on the device can see." -- which is itself a line a player
cannot act on, on a page written for players. The reader who needs to know why
the notes and the merge log differ is a developer reading the job log.

WHERE THIS TEXT IS READ, checked rather than assumed: the GitHub release page
only (crossplay-release.yml passes docs/release-body.md as body_path). The
device shows two version numbers and nothing else -- ReleaseJsonParser.cpp
parses tag_name, the asset name, its url and its size, and OtaUpdateActivity.cpp
draws STR_CURRENT_VERSION and STR_NEW_VERSION. So the prompt a device raises is
"there is a release", and this file answers "and here is what is in it"
somewhere else. That is still the sentence being fixed; it is just not on the
panel, and a check written as though it were would be measuring nothing.

Every input can be replaced for tests: --repo-dir, --pr-json (a file of pull
requests instead of gh), --last-tag.

    v1.12.17 announced seven changes. Four of them -- a board watcher, a
    server-side bridge and two release-pipeline fixes -- change nothing anybody
    receives, and they were the lines a reader met first. The release itself
    was right: an upstream sync moved the SDK, the SD font loader and about
    thirty translations. Only the notes were wrong.

    The question is one column of the table in
    scripts_local/device-build-needed.sh, and it is ASKED here rather than
    restated. Two questions read that table -- "does a device build need to
    run" and "could a person notice" -- and for one day they shared a single
    predicate whose unknown-path default was right for the first and wrong for
    the second. That is what cut v1.12.21 for a `.gitignore` edit. A second
    copy of the rule in Python would drift the first time somebody adds a
    top-level directory, silently, since the only symptom would be notes that
    quietly stopped mentioning something.

    THREE ANSWERS, because the same fault repeats one level down. "Should this
    cut a release" and "should this be a line on the page" are not one
    question either:

        yes    the change is in the thing a person uses, so whatever describes
               it describes it in their terms. A bullet.
        quiet  a person receives something different only in how the release
               was packaged. It cut the release (release-needed.sh treats it
               exactly like yes) and it earns a bullet only if the pull request
               wrote one -- see main(). Nothing in a build workflow describes
               itself in a player's words, and the fallback is the pull
               request's title: "build both devices in one pio run, and stop
               misdescribing why" is the prose this whole file exists to keep
               off that page.
        no     not a bullet, and not a release.

    `sha^1..sha` is the mainline parent against the merge, which is exactly
    what the landing added to xteink. --range diffs from the merge base, and
    the merge base of a merge and its own first parent is that parent, so this
    is the same range either way.

    Fail-safe is "yes", in every direction the script can fail: exit 1 is its
    only "no". Exit 2 is its refusal -- a changed path is in no row of the
    table -- and everything else is an unreadable range, a missing script or a
    crash. All of them print the bullet, and the refusal prints why. A bullet
    shown needlessly is noise; a bullet hidden wrongly is the bug this function
    exists to fix.
