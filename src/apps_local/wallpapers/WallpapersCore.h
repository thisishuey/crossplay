// enforces is worse than no comment. They are two different rules and a
// 2026-09-05 audit found six ways they disagree:
//
//   * this one checks the NAME only; findNextValidSleepImage also requires
//     Bitmap::parseHeaders() == Ok, so a corrupt file named .bmp is listed here
//     and skipped there;
//   * a BMP over 2048x3072, at 16bpp, or RLE-compressed is listed here and
//     rejected there (Bitmap.cpp:109-131);
//   * .png is accepted there in overlay mode and never here;
//   * names of 128..255 bytes are listed there and dropped here (this app's
//     buffer is 128, and SdFat returns "" rather than truncating);
//   * the 257th file in a folder is counted there and hidden here (kMaxLibrary);
//   * a valid BMP whose size is not kWallpaperFileBytes is listed here and
//     cannot be set at all -- setWallpaper refuses and the caller shows nothing.
//
// The two also never read the same directory: this filter walks /wallpapers,
// and findNextValidSleepImage only ever walks /.sleep, /sleep and the two
// overlay folders. The bridges between them are the byte copies this app makes
// -- to /sleep.bmp for one chosen wallpaper, into /.sleep for a set -- and both
// are size-checked at kWallpaperFileBytes on the way, so a file this app puts
// where the sleep screen looks is one the sleep screen accepts. A file somebody
// dropped in /.sleep by hand is the gap.
// host-tests/wallpapers asserts the name half, which is why the drift was

// its preview and its delete, and returning None there would make the sheet
// unreachable for exactly one wallpaper -- the one most likely to be held.
//
// `sleepBlocked` is card #354's rule, folded in here rather than left as an
// early return beside this call, because the two would otherwise compete for
// the same tap. "Already the sleep screen" is a reason to do NOTHING only when
// it can actually BE the sleep screen; when the settings block it, tapping the
// marked wallpaper again is what a person does after nothing happened, and it
// must re-pin and repair the settings. Holding it still opens the sheet, which
// is the ordering the two cards together require.
//
// `choosing`, `chosenCount` and `shadowedSet` are card #305's half, folded in
// here for the same reason #354's was: three cards now want this one tap, and
// three early returns beside each other is how one of them silently wins.

//     pictures is the obvious thing to want.
//   * a live set (two or more chosen) and NOT choosing: the tap opens the set
//     for editing with that tile toggled. It must never collapse the set to one
//     wallpaper: that is several taps of work undone by one, silently, under
//     the pixel that meant "add to the set" one chip-press earlier.
//   * shadowedSet: a stray /sleep.bmp (BmpViewerActivity, the File Transfer
//     page, a power cut mid-commit) is hiding a set. Tapping the marked
//     wallpaper is the user asking again, exactly as under sleepBlocked, and
