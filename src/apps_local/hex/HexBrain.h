// The opponent. UCT/MCTS over `hex::Game`, freestanding and deterministic: no
// heap, no clock of its own, no Arduino, and randomness only through the
// `uint32_t& seed` the caller lends. The same position, level and seed returns
// the same move on the device, in the simulator and in the host suite.
//
// **Why Monte Carlo and not a hand-written evaluation.** Hex has no material,
// no mobility and no king safety -- the only thing a position is worth is
// whether the connection can be completed, and every attempt to spell that out
// as a heuristic ends up re-deriving the search. It also has a property no
// other game on this shelf has: a FULL board always has exactly one winner, so
// a playout needs no legality check, no terminal test and no scoring pass. Fill
// every empty cell in a random order, then ask who owns the board. That is the
// whole evaluation, and it is why this fits a microcontroller at all.
//
// **Difficulty scales the POLICY, not just the budget.** Cazenave and Saffidine
// measured the bridge pattern in the playout policy at about +105 Elo over
// naive UCT, and AMAF/RAVE on top of it (with UCT exploration switched off) at
// a further +181 Elo -- together roughly what a 250-fold increase in compute
// buys. The gain is affordable here and the compute is not, so:
//
//   EASY    plain UCT, plain playouts, a small budget. Still takes an immediate
//           win and blocks an immediate loss at the root, so it never looks
//           broken -- a machine that walks past a winning move is not "easy",
//           it is wrong.
//   NORMAL  bridge-aware playouts.
//   HARD    bridge playouts plus RAVE, exploration off, the whole budget.
//
// Virtual connections and H-search are the next tier (MoHex territory) and are
// deliberately out of scope: they need a solver and a pattern database, and
// what they buy over this is invisible to anybody who is not already a Hex
// player.
//
// **The node pool belongs to the caller.** Forty-nine kilobytes is not a stack
// object and not something to allocate per move: the Activity takes one in
// onEnter() and frees it in onExit(), and the host tests put one on the heap of
// their own. That also makes the search re-entrant by construction -- it holds
// no state between calls except the two counters below, which are reporting.
