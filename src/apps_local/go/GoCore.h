// Go: the rules. Freestanding -- no renderer, no Activity, no storage, no heap.
//
// **Two board sizes, nine and thirteen, chosen per game.** Nineteen lines on a
// 480px panel gives a 24px grid pitch, which is below the fingertip this device
// is driven with, so it is not offered. Nine gives 49px and a game that
// finishes in twenty minutes on a train; thirteen gives 33px, which is playable
// because a stone goes down in two taps rather than one and the first tap can
// be moved (see GoFlow.h).
//
// The size is a FIELD of the game rather than a compile-time constant. It was a
// constant, and every rule in this file read it from the same place the screens
// did, so making it a setting meant threading it through: `game.points()`,
// `game.row(p)`, `neighbours(size, ...)`. The arrays are sized for the larger
// board and a nine by nine game simply uses the first 81 of them.
//
// **Area scoring (Chinese), situational superko, komi 7.5.** That combination is
// what every engine plays because it makes a finished position scorable by
// counting alone -- no prisoners to remember, no dame to haggle over, no seki
// exception. It is also the ruleset a beginner never has to learn: they put
// stones down and the machine counts.
//
// The one place this ruleset is user-visible is the END of the game, and it is
// handled in `GoFlow.h` rather than here: under area scoring the engine would
// happily fill every neutral point, which reads as an idiot to a human. The
// rules here stop at "two passes ends it"; who is dead is a separate agreement.
//
// This struct IS the wire format and IS the save format: trivially copyable,
// comfortably inside the link layer's 192-byte packet, so two devices share one
// description of a game and cannot drift. A thirteen by thirteen position does
// not fit at one byte a point, which is why the board is held two bits a point
// and reached through `at()` and `put()` rather than indexed directly.
//
// The exact size is deliberately NOT written here. It was, as 140, and adding
// one byte for `accepted` made every copy of that number wrong at once -- in
// this file, in GoEngine.cpp and twice in docs/apps/go.md. The suite asserts
// the ceiling, which is the only part that matters.
