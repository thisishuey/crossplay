// The bridge between this app's rules and michi-c2's engine.
//
// Two boards again, and for the same reason the last engine had two: `go::Game`
// is the game -- the wire format, the save payload, the thing the screens draw
// -- and michi has its own `Position`, with a bordered array, block ids and
// incremental liberty sets it needs to be fast. Neither wants to be the other.
//
// So this file owns the one conversion, in one direction, and every michi
// symbol stays behind it: nothing else in the app includes a michi header, and
// michi never learns that go::Game exists.
