// Go's navigation, its settings, and the one piece of state that lives between
// two taps. Freestanding.
//
// Two machines, as Checkers has: `Screen` is the shell and the only thing Back
// navigates, `Phase` is the game. The third thing here is the AIM -- the point
// a finger has chosen but not yet committed -- which belongs to neither.
//
// **A stone goes down in two taps, not one.** Go is played on intersections at
// a 49px pitch on nine lines and 33px on thirteen, which is at or under a
// fingertip, and a stone cannot be taken back in a match. So the first tap aims
// and the second commits, and tapping a different point moves the aim rather
// than playing there. It costs one tap on a move you were sure of and saves a
// game on the one you were not -- and it is what makes the larger board
// offerable at all. Checkers already reads this way (pick, then place) and
// chess has read this way since it was written, so it is also the gesture this
// device has taught.
