// How much stack michi's deepest path needs, and why it is not the loop task's.
//
// The search descends tree_search -> tree_descend -> expand, and from the
// playout policy into fix_atari -> read_ladder_attack, which recurses through
// fix_atari_r back into itself once per ply of a ladder. Upstream runs that on
// a desktop with an eight megabyte stack; the Arduino loop task on this chip
// gets eight KILOBYTES, and one frame of expand() alone was 8.5KB before the
// vendored copy was trimmed.
//
// So the search gets a task of its own, created when the app opens and ended
// when it closes, and the loop waits on it.
//
// The number is measured, and here is the whole of the arithmetic, because
// scripts_local/stack_budget.py can only do the first half of it -- it reports
// cycles and never sums them:
//
//   12,192  the deepest ACYCLIC path, from that tool on gh_release_x4pro.
//           searchLoop -> chooseMove -> genmove -> tree_search -> tree_descend
//           -> expand (2,816) -> gen_playout_moves_capture -> fix_atari (6,496)
//           -> one level of the ladder reader.
//   11,792  eleven more levels of that reader at 1,072 bytes each
//           (read_ladder_attack 32 + read_ladder_attack_r 448 + fix_atari_r
//           592), which is MICHI_LADDER_MAX = 12 in michi.c.
//    1,760  the deepest thing under the last level, undo_move.
//   ------
//   25,744  against 32,768, leaving about 7KB.
