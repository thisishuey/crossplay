/**
 * ActivityManager
 *
 * This mirrors the same concept of Activity in Android, where an activity represents a single screen of the UI. The
 * manager is responsible for launching activities, and ensuring that only one activity is active at a time.
 *
 * It also provides a stack mechanism to allow activities to launch sub-activities and get back the results when the
 * sub-activity is done. For example, the WebServer activity can launch a WifiSelect activity to let the user choose a
 * wifi network, and get back the selected network when the user is done.
 *
 * Main differences from Android's ActivityManager:
 * - No onPause/onResume, since we don't have a concept of background activities
 * - onActivityResult is implemented via a callback instead of a separate method, for simplicity
