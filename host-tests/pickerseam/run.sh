# WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS AT ALL. WifiSelectionActivity finishes on the button
# PRESS; the RELEASE arrives ~77ms later at the caller underneath, which never
# saw the press and reads it as its own input. On a device that has never
# joined Wi-Fi that made Hacker News unopenable -- the app puts the picker in
# front of itself and backing out of the picker shut the app, so the saved
# shelf, the half that exists for having no network, needed a network to reach.
# Eleven files launch that picker and act on a release; fifty-five files in
# src/ act on a release at all.
#
# WHY IT IS THE ONLY PLACE THIS IS CHECKED. The simulator cannot see this class
# of bug: it does not compile lib/hal, and its latch clears in beginFrame()
# rather than update(), so the two edges never land in different activities
# there. A green simulator run says nothing about it, in either direction.
#
# TWO REGISTERS, AND THE SECOND ONE IS NEW. The gate is freestanding, so the
# first part builds with nothing but the standard library -- if the state
# machine ever reaches for HalGPIO, SETTINGS or the renderer, this build fails
# loudly instead of the logic quietly becoming device-only and therefore
# untested.
#
# The flip side used to be written here as an admission: the WIRING was not
# checked, only read. That is what let the arm be written at two of the three
# points currentActivity changes -- the missing one is the immediate branch of
# replaceActivity(), which is how Back leaves the crash report, and the release
# went on to open the most recently read book. So the wiring is asserted below
# instead of described: assignments funnelled through one setter, the gate
# consulted for the release edge and nothing else, Power left out of the gated
# list, and both settle paths present. A source scan is a blunt instrument, but
# the alternative here was an enumeration, and the enumeration is what failed.
