// How long a prewarmed glyph cache lives, and what that rules out.
//
// The reader warmed the NEXT page's glyphs while the device sat idle, so a page
// turn would not have to. The simulator showed it prewarming each page twice
// with byte-for-byte identical results, 780ms apart -- once for the idle pass
// and once for the render that immediately followed it. The reason is here:
// FontCacheManager::PrewarmScope clears the cache when it is constructed AND
// when it is destroyed, so glyphs warmed inside a scope cannot outlive it, and
// the next render's own scope would drop them at its constructor anyway.
//
// Two independent reasons for the same outcome is exactly the sort of fact that
// should fail a test rather than be re-derived by the next person who tries to
// keep a cache across a page turn. That is what this suite is.
//
// The FontCacheManager under test is real. Only SdCardFont is faked, and only
// the five methods FontCacheManager reaches for, so the lifetime being asserted
// is the shipping one.
