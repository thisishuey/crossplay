#
# This script decides whether four cross-compiled device builds are SKIPPED, so
# a wrong "not needed" ships a firmware nothing compiled. Every assertion below
# is therefore written from the skip's point of view: the interesting direction
# is not "does it build when it should", it is "does it ever skip when it must
# not". Hence the unknown-directory case, which is the one that protects the
# rule against the next person adding a top-level directory that feeds the
# image.
#
# It also owns the OTHER column of the same table, `ships` (--ships), read by
# release-needed.sh and release_notes.py. The two columns have opposite risk
# profiles -- a wrong "build" costs runner minutes, a wrong "release" puts an
# update prompt on every device in the field -- and for a day they shared one
# predicate whose unknown-path default was live. That released v1.12.21 for a
# `.gitignore` edit. The "two columns, one table" block near the end is the
# assertion that they cannot be collapsed back into one: it names paths whose
# two answers DIFFER, in both directions.
