"""Every game and app on the shelf is named on the site and in the README.

The shelf is the product and the page is how anyone finds out what is on it,
and nothing connected the two. SUDOKU shipped in v1.3.x and GET BOOKS in
v1.3.6; on 2026-08-29 neither appeared anywhere on the site -- eleven releases
of a game nobody browsing could see. FOREHEAD was on the page and missing from
the README the same day. None of that is visible in a build, in a render or in
a read-through, because what is absent looks like nothing at all.

The list is read out of Shelf.cpp, which is what actually decides what a device
shows, so a new app fails this until somebody writes it up. Prints one line per
gap and nothing when there are none; host-tests/site/run.sh counts the lines.

# release notes said "Eight of them" and named eight, months after Toy Battle
# became the ninth. The truth is LinkPlay.h's GameId enum -- an id is what a
# device actually offers to play -- so the sentence is checked against it.
#
# THE RELEASE PAGE IS NO LONGER ONE OF THE PLACES CHECKED, because it no longer
# enumerates: docs/release-body.md carries one sentence with no names and no
# number in it. The list moved out on 2026-09-04, when the page stopped being
# the archive as well. What this therefore no longer examines is whether the
# release page names every game -- it deliberately names none, and the check
# further down asserts that it stays that way rather than leaving the question
# unasked.
