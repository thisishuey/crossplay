"""Publish site/emulator/ as GitHub release assets and write the manifest.

WHY THIS EXISTS. site/emulator/ used to be committed. It is 3.7MB that changes
on every firmware merge, and crossplay-emulator.yml committed a fresh copy after
each one: 111 blob revisions of crossplay.wasm alone, ~357MB of history, 56 of
those revisions in one week. The repository reached ~497MB on GitHub for a
~104MB checkout and grew about 20MB a day, forever, which every clone and every
CI checkout in the fork pays for.

Ignoring the directory is not on its own an option, and .gitignore said so for
months: Vercel has no Emscripten, so a git-connected deploy that cannot see
these files ships a site whose headline feature 404s. The browser demo is the
first thing the README offers a stranger.

So the bytes go somewhere a clone does not follow -- a GitHub release asset --
and the repository keeps a pointer instead:

    site/emulator-manifest.json     ~1KB, one commit per rebuild

`site/fetch-emulator.mjs` reads that manifest during Vercel's build and puts the
files back before the site is served. A download that fails or arrives with the
wrong bytes fails the build, so a broken fetch leaves the PREVIOUS deployment
serving rather than shipping a 404.

    python3 tools_local/site/publish_emulator.py                # upload + write
    python3 tools_local/site/publish_emulator.py --dry-run      # write only

THREE THINGS ABOUT THE DESIGN, each of which is load-bearing:

  * Asset names are CONTENT-ADDRESSED (`<sha256[:16]>-crossplay.wasm`). A
    rolling name updated in place would break every redeploy of an older
    commit -- Vercel's Redeploy button and its rollbacks both rebuild an old
    tree, whose manifest names bytes that no longer exist under that name. With
    a content address, an old manifest keeps resolving as long as the asset is
    there, and a rebuild that changes nothing uploads nothing.

  * The manifest records `built_from`, the source revision, and it is what makes
    the commit non-empty. scripts_local/emulator-stale.sh compares the last
    commit touching the artefact against the last one touching its sources, and
    that comparison is unsatisfiable when a rebuild produces identical bytes --
    the same reason site/emulator/BUILT_FROM was invented. The revision always
    changes, so the manifest always changes, so the gate can always be met.

  * The files are verified to BE brotli before they are published. They are
    served with `Content-Encoding: br` (see site/vercel.json and
    tools_local/site/precompress.py), and publishing raw bytes behind that
    header ships a wasm no browser can decode -- with no error anywhere,
    because nothing on the wire is wrong until the decoder gives up.
